This method will configure the access parameters to the local hardware and initiate a WebSockets connection to the image server. Wait until the ``Color filter is running`` message, and make sure the WebSockets connection is opened by seeking for the corresponding ``Websocket Opened`` message. You will also see two buttons:\n",
